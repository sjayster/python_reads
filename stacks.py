"""
Stack is a LIFO data structure. Meaning, the element that was added towards the end will be removed first.
The elements are added in a sequential fashion.
If elt1 is added to stack[0], elt2 will be added to stack[1]
Higher the index, newer the element. And the newest element will be popped first.

Essential stack operations are:
1. Check to see if the stack is empty
2. Add an element to the stack - push()
3. Return the top most element of the stack - top()
4. Remove an element from the stack - pop()
5. Get the size of the stack - size()
6. Print the contents of the stack - print_stack()
